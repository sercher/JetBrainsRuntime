 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/ThreadGroupReference/suspend/suspend001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 *     ThreadGroupReference.
 *     The test checks up that a result of the method
 *     com.sun.jdi.ThreadGroupReference.suspend()
 *     complies with its spec:
 *     public void suspend()
 *     Suspends all threads in this thread group.
 *     Each thread in this group and in all of its subgroups will be suspended as
 *     described in ThreadReference.suspend(). This is not guaranteed to be
 *     an atomic operation; if the target VM is not interrupted
 *     at the time this method is called, it is possible that new threads
 *     will be created between the time that
 *     threads are enumerated and all of them have been suspended.
 *     Throws: ObjectCollectedException -
 *             if this object has been garbage collected.
 *     when a ThreadGroupReference object has not been garbage collected,
 *     hence ObjectCollectedException is not expected to be thrown.
 *     The test works as follows:
 *     The debugger program - nsk.jdi.ThreadGroupReference.suspend.suspend001;
 *     the debuggee program - nsk.jdi.ThreadGroupReference.suspend.suspend001a.
 *     Using nsk.jdi.share classes,
 *     the debugger gets the debuggee running on another JavaVM,
 *     creates the object debuggee.VM,
 *     establishes a pipe with the debuggee program, and then
 *     send to the programm commands, to which the debuggee replies
 *     via the pipe. Upon getting reply,
 *     the debugger calls corresponding debuggee.VM methods to get
 *     needed data and compares the data got to the data expected.
 *     In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and
 *     a corresponding error message(s).
 *     Otherwise, the test is passed and produces
 *     the return value 95 and no message.
